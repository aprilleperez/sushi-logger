# Sushi-Logger

## Description
Sushi Logger is a full stack app utilizing the MVC file structure for rendering Handlebars' backend files into the frontend. The user can input sushis they would like to eat, which will be shown in the "Sushi you're thinking about" section, and sushi that has been eaten (either stored data or active data from button click) will be shown in the "Sushi you've inhaled" section. The app utilizes data persistence in that it updates in real-time the actions of the user in relation to the database. The database sorts the sushis' devoured state between true or false and storing it to the database for continued tracking!

## Languages
- Frontend: CSS, Javascript/jQuery/AJAX
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL, ORM, Handlebars, MVC file structure
