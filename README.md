# Sushi-Logger

## Description
Sushi Logger is a full stack app utilizing the MVC file structure for rendering Handlebars' backend files into the frontend. The user can input sushis they would like to eat, which will be shown in the "Sushi you're thinking about" section, and sushi that has been eaten (either stored data or active data from button click) will be shown in the "Sushi you've inhaled" section. The app utilizes data persistence in that it updates in real-time the actions of the user in relation to the database. The database sorts the sushis' devoured state between true or false and storing it to the database for continued tracking!

## Languages
- Frontend: CSS, Javascript/jQuery/AJAX
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL, ORM, Handlebars, MVC file structure

## IMPORTANT!
Please be sure to "npm install" the listed dependencies in the package.json folder. Similarly, if this does not work, please "npm init -y" to initialize a package.json file, and npm install the following packages from the NPM website: express, express-handlebars, mysql.

## Takeaways
This app was way harder than expected. I felt that I understood Handlebars and spent the least amount of time on it, however the routing and database configuration was the most challenging part (so I would rename this assignment more towards that). This will be a good app to keep for my reference since I spent good chunks amount of time on each file and added in my notes.

## Feedback
I would definitely want to think of a more streamlined way to structure my function codes that clears up my confusion with what's happening. In terms of feedback I have for this assignment is offering walkthroughs/live demos on crucial steps like deploying to heroku. 
Any other form of feedback would be much appreciated!
